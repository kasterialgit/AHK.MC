# What is AHK.MC?

AHK.MC was created with the intentions of adding automated elements to minecraft. It also has the capabilitie to operate both Baritone and Altoclef features.

AHK.MC is based on AutoHotKey and has been modified and optimized to communicate directly with the Minecraft Client.

New automated game features have been programmed in AHK.MC allowing select users to use them on any online servers.

Why use AutoHotKey? While AutoHotKey (AHK) isn't the best language for this, the project is a continuation of a now discontinued Minecraft AHK libary (Anarchy.Bot.Bar.ahk) and this put the foundations in place to make it possible.

Powered by Baritone, AltoClef, and AHK.

# What is AutoHotKey?

AutoHotkey is a free, open source macro-creation and automation software utility that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a custom scripting language that has special provision for defining keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys.

# What is Baritone?

A Minecraft pathfinder bot.

# What is Altoclef?

Plays block game.

Powered by Baritone.

A client side bot that can accomplish any Minecraft task that is relatively simple and can be split into smaller tasks. "Relatively Simple" is a vague term, so check the list of current capabilities to see examples.
